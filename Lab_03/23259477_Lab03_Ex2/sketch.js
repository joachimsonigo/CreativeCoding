Antonio borrows money from Shylock, a Jewish moneylender, to help his friend to court Portia. Antonio cannot repay the loan, and without mercy, Shylock demands a pound of his flesh. The Duke of Venice, the ruler of the city, cannot help Antonio. Portia, disguised as a lawyer, saves Antonio by pointing out that Shylock cannot take his flesh without shedding blood. Shylock is punished for trying to kill Antonio. Antonio and Portia are married, as are their friends Bassanio and Nerissa.");
